## Exercise 5.1
>What is a null statement? When might you use a null statement?
A null statement is the empty statement. like this:
```cpp
; // null statement
```
The null statement may be used as a placeholder when a statement is expected. For example:
```cpp
// read until we hit end-of-file or find an input equal to sought
while (cin >> s && s != sought)
    ; // null statement.
```

## Exercise 5.2
>What is a block? When might you might use a block?

A block is a (possibly empty) sequence of statements and declarations surrounded by a pair of curly braces.It's used when multiple statements are needed.For example:
```cpp
while (val <= 10)
{
    sum += val;
    ++val;
}
```
## Exercise 5.3
>Use the comma operator (ยง 4.10, p. 157, p. 140 chinese edition) to rewrite the while loop from ยง 1.4.1 (p. 11, p. 11 chinese edition) so that it no longer requires a block. Explain whether this rewrite improves or diminishes the readability of this code.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main()
{
    int sum = 0, val = 1;
    while (val <= 10)
        sum += val, ++val;
    std::cout << "Sum of 1 to 10 inclusive is " << sum << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```
This rewritten version diminishes the readability. 
## Exercise 5.4
>Explain each of the following examples, and correct any problems you detect.
    - (a) while (string::iterator iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
    - (b) while (bool status = find(word)) { /* . . . */ } if (!status) { /* . . . */ }

Solution:
(a) illegal declaration: `string::iterator iter != s.end()`
```cpp
string::iterator iter = s.begin;
while (iter != s.end()) { /* . . . */ }
```

(b)  Variable `status` is only declared inside scope of while condition.
```cpp
//corrrected as:
bool status;
while (status = find(word)) { /* ... */ }
if (!status) { /* ... */ }
```  
## [Exercise 5.5](ex5_5.cpp)
## [Exercise 5.6](ex5_6.cpp)
## Exercise 5.7
>Correct the errors in each of the following code fragments:
```cpp
(a) if (ival1 != ival2) ival1 = ival2
    else ival1 = ival2 = 0;
(b) if (ival < minval) minval = ival;
    occurs = 1;
(c) if (int ival = get_value())
    cout << "ival = " << ival << endl;
    if (!ival)
    cout << "ival = 0\n";
(d) if (ival = 0)
    ival = get_value();
```
