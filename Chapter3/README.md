## Exercise 3.2

##### [part1](/Chapter3/ex3_2a.cc)
##### [part2](/Chapter3/ex3_2b.cc)

## Exercise 3.3
>Explain how whitespace characters are handled in the string input operator and in the `getline` function.

- For code like `is >> s`, input is separated by whitespaces while reading into string `s`.
- For code like `getline(is, s)` input is separated by newline `\n` while reading into string `s`. Other whitespaces are ignored.
- For code like `getline(is, s, delim)`input is separated by `delim` while reading into string `s`. All whitespaces are ignored.

## [Exercise 3.6](/Chapter3/ex3_6.cc)

## Exercise 3.7
>What would happen if you define the loop control variable in the previous exercise as type char? Predict the results and then change your program to use a char to see if you were right.

`c ` would become a `char` rather than `char &`, in such case, `c` won't change anymore.

```cpp
string str("a simple string");
for (char c : str) c = 'X';
```
## [Exercise 3.8](/Chapter3/ex3_8.cc)
The range for statement is better, it does not directly manipulate the index, and is more concise.

## Exercise 3.9
>What does the following program do? Is it valid? If not, why not?
```cpp
string s;
cout << s[0] << endl; 
```
This code was dereferencing and printing the first item stored in `s`.
`s` is empty, the operation is invalid.
a.k.a. **undefined behavior**. 

## [Exercise 3.10](/Chapter3/ex3_10.cc)

## Exercise 3.11
>Is the following range for legal? If so, what is the type of c?
```cpp
const string s = "Keep out!";
for (auto &c : s){ /*... */ }
```

It depends on the code block in loop body. For example,
```cpp
    cout << c;      //legal
    c = 'X'         // illegal, cause c is const char&
```

## Exercise 3.12
>Which, if any, of the following vector definitions are in error? For those that are legal, explain what the definition does. For those that are not legal, explain why they are illegal.
```cpp
vector<vector<int>> ivec;         // legal
vector<string> svec = ivec;       // illegal. type is different
vector<string> svec(10, "null");  // legal. vector have 10 strings: "null"
```
## Exercise 3.13
>How many elements are there in each of the following vectors? What are the values of the elements?
```cpp
vector<int> v1;                 // size:0 value:no value
vector<int> v2(10);             // size:10 value:0
vector<int> v3(10, 42);         // size:10 value:42
vector<int> v4{ 10 };           // size:1 value:10
vector<int> v5{ 10, 42 };       // size:2 value:10 42
vector<string> v6{ 10 };        // size:10 value:""
vector<string> v7{ 10, "hi" };  // size:10 value:"hi"
```
## [Exercise 3.14](/Chapter3/ex3_14.cc)
## [Exercise 3.15](/Chapter3/ex3_15.cc)
## [Exercise 3.16](/Chapter3/ex3_16.cc)
## [Exercise 3.17](/Chapter3/ex3_17.cc)
## [Exercise 3.18](/Chapter3/ex3_18.cc)
Illegal
## Exercise 3.19
>// List three ways to define a vector and give it ten elements,each with the value 42. Indicate whether there is a preferred way to do so and why.
```cpp
//1st
vector<int> ivec(10.42);
//2nd
vector<int> ivec{42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42,42};
//3rd
vector<int> ivec;
for(int i = 0; i <10 ; ++i)
{
    ivec.push_back(42);
}
```
The 1st one is better.
